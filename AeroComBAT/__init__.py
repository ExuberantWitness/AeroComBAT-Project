"""A tool for modeling composite beams and aircraft wings.

 ``Aerodynamics``
     This module provides the aerodynamics models used within AeroComBAT
 ``AircraftParts``
     This module provides a full-fledged wing object that can be used to
     determine if a design is both statically adequate as well as stable.
 ``FEM``
     This module provides a finite element model object, intended as a
     convenient way for a user to create and model composite structures and
     potential flow lifting surfaces.
 ``Structures``
     This module provides the structural models used within AeroComBAT.
